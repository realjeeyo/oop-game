Hello!

If you want to simply run the game, just download "The Binding of Gran.zip" and extract it and run the .exe file.

This was a unity project made using C#, with the concepts of OOP being the main focus.

If you want to open the Unity Project, download "My project.zip" and extract it to an empty directory and open it using Unity Hub.

Thanks! Happy Playing/Coding!
